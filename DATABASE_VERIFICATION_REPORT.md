### Columns
- `id` - INTEGER (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `polling_station_id` - INTEGER (Foreign Key → polling_stations)
- `election_year` - INTEGER (NOT NULL)
- `registered_voters` - INTEGER (NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0)
- `actual_turnout` - INTEGER (NULL)
- `data_source` - VARCHAR (NULL)
- `verified` - BOOLEAN (DEFAULT false)
- `created_at` - TIMESTAMP (DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` - TIMESTAMP (DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

### Indexes

## 📝 Next Steps

### Frontend Integration
- Query `voter_registration_history` table for historical data
- Join with `polling_stations` for location details
- Join with `counties` for county-level aggregations
- Implement year selector (2017, 2022)

### Example Query
```sql
SELECT 
    ps.code,
    ps.name,
    c.name as county,
    vrh.election_year,
    vrh.registered_voters
FROM voter_registration_history vrh
JOIN polling_stations ps ON ps.id = vrh.polling_station_id
JOIN counties c ON ps.county_id = c.id
WHERE vrh.election_year = 2022
ORDER BY vrh.registered_voters DESC;
```
