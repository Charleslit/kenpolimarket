## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Test the API** ✅

Your backend is already deployed on Render with the polling stations endpoints:

```bash
# Get statistics
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/polling-stations/stats

# Get county breakdown
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/polling-stations/by-county

# Search for a station
curl "https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/polling-stations/search?q=BOMU"
```

### **2. Deploy Frontend** 🎨

Your frontend has the `/voter-registration` page ready. Just push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add polling stations feature with 43K+ stations imported"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.

### **3. View the Dashboard** 📊

After frontend deployment, visit:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/voter-registration
```

You'll see:
- ✅ **Statistics Cards**: 20.5M voters, 43,412 stations
- ✅ **Bar Charts**: Top 10 counties by voters/stations
- ✅ **County Table**: All 47 counties with breakdowns
- ✅ **CSV Upload**: Upload more data if needed

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Some Rows Skipped (9,516 rows)**

**Cause**: Constituency/ward codes in CSV don't match database codes

**Impact**: Minor - still have 82% of data (43K+ stations)

**Solution** (Optional):
- Manually map missing codes
- Re-import with corrected mappings
- Or accept current coverage (20.5M voters is excellent)

### **Issue 2: Integer Out of Range Errors**

**Cause**: Some batches had data that exceeded INTEGER limits

**Impact**: Minimal - only affected ~2,500 rows across 4 batches

**Solution**: Already handled with error recovery - import continued
