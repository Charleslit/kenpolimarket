## Deployment

### Initial Deployment

- [ ] Monthly security audit scheduled
- [ ] Disk space monitoring configured

### Documentation
- [ ] Deployment documented
- [ ] Access credentials stored securely
- [ ] Runbook created for common issues

- [ ] Emergency contacts documented

## Rollback Plan

### Preparation
- [ ] Previous version tagged in git
- [ ] Database backup before deployment
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Rollback tested in staging environment

### Rollback Steps (if needed)
```bash
# 1. Stop current services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# 2. Checkout previous version
git checkout <previous-tag>

# 3. Restore database backup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T postgres psql -U kenpolimarket kenpolimarket < backup.sql

# 4. Rebuild and restart
./deploy.sh  # Select option 1
```

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### If services won't start:
- [ ] Check logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs`
- [ ] Check disk space: `df -h`
- [ ] Check memory: `free -h`
- [ ] Check ports: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(80|443|3000|8000|5432|6379)'`
- [ ] Restart services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart`

### If frontend can't connect to backend:
- [ ] Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.production`
- [ ] Check nginx configuration
- [ ] Check backend logs
- [ ] Test API directly: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`

### If database errors occur:
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL logs
- [ ] Verify database credentials
- [ ] Check database connection string
- [ ] Restart PostgreSQL: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart postgres`

## Performance Optimization

### After Initial Deployment
- [ ] Enable Redis caching
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets (optional)
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add database indexes
- [ ] Enable gzip compression in nginx
- [ ] Configure browser caching
- [ ] Optimize images and assets

### Scaling (if needed)

- [ ] Configure load balancer (for multiple servers)
- [ ] Set up database replication (for high availability)
- [ ] Configure Redis cluster (for high availability)
