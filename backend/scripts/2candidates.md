### Key Narrative from the Comprehensive Data:

This table reveals the dramatic political realignment required for a Matiang'i victory in 2027:

*   **The Mount Kenya Cataclysm:** The most critical shift. In 2022, this region was Ruto's fortress, giving him massive margins (e.g., 776k in Kiambu). In 2027, it becomes Matiang'i's strongest base. Ruto losing 60% of his support here (from ~70-90% down to 30%) represents a loss of over 2 million votes, creating an insurmountable deficit.

*   **The Opposition Merger:** Matiang'i's coalition is built by merging Raila's 2022 base with a large portion of Ruto's 2022 base. He holds most of Raila's votes in Nyanza, Western, and Coast (though at a reduced 60% instead of Raila's 80-90%), while adding the colossal new bloc of Mount Kenya.

*   **Ruto's Contained Gains:** Ruto's strategy relies on growing his vote in his 2022 strongholds (Rift Valley, Northern) and making historic inroads in Raila's 2022 base (Luo Nyanza). He succeeds in increasing his raw numbers in these areas (e.g., from 42k to 215k in Kisumu), but these gains are narrow and are completely overwhelmed by his catastrophic losses in Mount Kenya.

*   **The Decisive New Voters:** The 6 million new voters, breaking 60% for Matiang'i, provide the final, decisive margin. This reflects the potent combination of anti-incumbency sentiment and a demographic shift that the opposition successfully harnesses.

This projection illustrates that defeating an incumbent requires not just unifying the traditional opposition, but triggering a massive rebellion within the incumbent's own core base. Matiang'i wins by building a new, broader national coalition than either Ruto or Raila had in 2022.
