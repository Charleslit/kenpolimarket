# ✅ Candidate Display Filter Applied!

## 🎯 **What Was Changed**

The National Dashboard now **filters out minor candidates** with less than 1% vote share, showing only the meaningful candidates in your forecast.

---

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before (Showing All 5 Candidates):**
```
1. Fred Matiang'i    - 58.4% (11.44M votes)
2. William Ruto      - 41.2% (8.07M votes)
3. Raila Odinga      - 0.2%  (0.04M votes)  ← Cluttering the view
4. Kalonzo Musyoka   - 0.1%  (0.02M votes)  ← Cluttering the view
5. Musalia Mudavadi  - 0.1%  (0.01M votes)  ← Cluttering the view
```

### **After (Showing Only Main Candidates):**
```
1. Fred Matiang'i    - 58.4% (11.44M votes)
2. William Ruto      - 41.2% (8.07M votes)
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **File Modified:** `frontend/components/dashboard/NationalDashboard.tsx`

**Added Filter:**
```typescript
// Sort candidates by vote share and filter out minor candidates (< 1%)
const sortedCandidates = [...summary.candidates]
  .sort((a, b) => b.predicted_vote_share - a.predicted_vote_share)
  .filter(c => c.predicted_vote_share >= 1.0); // Only show candidates with 1% or more
```

**Filter Threshold:** 1.0% vote share

---

## ✅ **What This Means**

### **Dashboard Display:**
- ✅ **Only shows candidates with ≥1% vote share**
- ✅ **Cleaner, more focused view**
- ✅ **Charts show only meaningful candidates**
- ✅ **Detailed breakdown shows only main contenders**

### **Data Integrity:**
- ✅ **All data still in database** - Nothing deleted
- ✅ **API still returns all candidates** - Full data available
- ✅ **Only frontend display filtered** - Backend unchanged
- ✅ **Can adjust threshold easily** - Change 1.0 to any value

## 🎨 **What You'll See Now**

### **National Overview:**
- **Bar Chart:** Only Ruto vs Matiang'i
- **Pie Chart:** Only 2 slices (Ruto 41.2%, Matiang'i 58.4%)
- **Detailed Breakdown:** Only 2 candidate cards
- **Hero Stats:** Winner and runner-up only

### **Charts Affected:**
1. **Bar Chart** - 2 bars instead of 5
2. **Pie Chart** - 2 slices instead of 5
3. **Candidate Cards** - 2 cards instead of 5
4. **Winner Display** - Still shows Matiang'i as winner

---

## 📈 **Why This Makes Sense**

### **Your Scenario: "Ruto vs Unified Opposition"**

The scenario models a **two-horse race** between:
1. **Fred Matiang'i** (Unified Opposition) - 58.4%
2. **William Ruto** (Incumbent) - 41.2%

The other candidates (Raila, Kalonzo, Musalia) have **negligible vote shares** (0.1-0.2%) because:
- The opposition has **unified behind Matiang'i**
- Raila, Kalonzo, and Musalia are **not major contenders**
- Their votes are just **mathematical remainders** from the 70% turnout calculation

**Filtering them out makes the visualization cleaner and more accurate to the scenario's narrative.**

## 🔄 **How to Adjust the Filter**

If you want to change the threshold:

### **Show All Candidates (No Filter):**
```typescript
const sortedCandidates = [...summary.candidates]
  .sort((a, b) => b.predicted_vote_share - a.predicted_vote_share);
  // Remove the .filter() line
```

### **Different Threshold (e.g., 5%):**
```typescript
const sortedCandidates = [...summary.candidates]
  .sort((a, b) => b.predicted_vote_share - a.predicted_vote_share)
  .filter(c => c.predicted_vote_share >= 5.0); // 5% threshold
```

### **Show Top N Candidates:**
```typescript
const sortedCandidates = [...summary.candidates]
  .sort((a, b) => b.predicted_vote_share - a.predicted_vote_share)
  .slice(0, 2); // Show only top 2
```
