# Quick Reference: Constituency Data

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (290/290 constituencies)

---

## Current Database Status

```
Counties:       47 ✅ (100%)
Constituencies: 290 ✅ (100%)
Wards:          1,369 ✅ (94.4%)
```

---

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Missing 17 constituencies (had 273, needed 290)

**Root Cause:** CSV parsing bug with multi-word county names
- "UASIN GISHU" → Split into "UASIN" and "GISHU"
- "NAIROBI CITY" → Split into "NAIROBI" and "CITY"

**Solution:** Enhanced parser with offset detection

**Result:** All 290 constituencies now imported ✅

## How to Re-import Data

If you need to re-import from scratch:

```bash
# 1. Clear existing data
docker exec kenpolimarket-postgres psql -U kenpolimarket -d kenpolimarket \
  -c "DELETE FROM wards; DELETE FROM constituencies;"

# 2. Run import script
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate
python ../scripts/import_iebc_data.py

# 3. Regenerate GeoJSON
python ../scripts/create_geojson_from_db.py

# 4. Restart Next.js
# (in another terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

---

## Verification Commands

### Check constituency count:
```bash
docker exec kenpolimarket-postgres psql -U kenpolimarket -d kenpolimarket \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM constituencies;"
# Expected: 290
```

### Check Uasin Gishu:
```bash
docker exec kenpolimarket-postgres psql -U kenpolimarket -d kenpolimarket \
  -c "SELECT code, name FROM constituencies WHERE code::int BETWEEN 141 AND 146 ORDER BY code::int;"
# Expected: 6 rows (141-146)
```

### Check Nairobi:
```bash
docker exec kenpolimarket-postgres psql -U kenpolimarket -d kenpolimarket \
  -c "SELECT code, name FROM constituencies WHERE code::int BETWEEN 274 AND 290 ORDER BY code::int;"
# Expected: 17 rows (274-290)
```

## Production Deployment

**Status:** ✅ Ready for production

**Checklist:**

## Key Insights

1. **The data was complete** - IEBC CSV has all 290 constituencies
2. **The parser was incomplete** - Failed to handle multi-word county names
3. **Kenya officially has 290 constituencies** - Verified via Wikipedia, IEBC, Constitution
4. **2 special constituencies exist** - DIASPORA and PRISONS (not county-based)
