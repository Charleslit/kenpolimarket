# 📤 Push to GitHub - Step by Step

Your code is committed locally. Now let's push it to GitHub!

---

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files added
- ✅ Initial commit created (108 files, 30,243 lines)
- ✅ Branch renamed to 'main'

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon (top right) → **"New repository"**
3. Configure:
   - **Repository name:** `kenpolimarket`
   - **Description:** `Kenya Political Forecasting & Analysis Platform`
   - **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kenpolimarket.git
```

Copy this URL!

### Step 3: Add Remote and Push

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kenpolimarket.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## 🔐 If You Need Authentication

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

If GitHub asks for a password:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `kenpolimarket-deploy`
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use the token as your password when pushing

### Option 2: SSH Key

If you prefer SSH:

```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy the public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
# Then use SSH URL instead:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/kenpolimarket.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✅ Verify Push

After pushing, check:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. You should see all 108 files
3. The README.md should be displayed
4. All deployment guides should be visible

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

Once pushed to GitHub, you can deploy to:

### Option 1: Vercel + Render (15 minutes)
📖 See [VERCEL_RENDER_QUICKSTART.md](./VERCEL_RENDER_QUICKSTART.md)

### Option 2: Docker VPS (10 minutes)
📖 See [START_HERE_DEPLOYMENT.md](./START_HERE_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied"
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys

### "Repository not found"
- Check the URL is correct
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub
- Verify you're logged into the correct GitHub account

### "Failed to push"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the remote URL: `git remote -v`
- Try: `git pull origin main --rebase` then `git push`
