## 🔢 **About the "NEW VOTERS" Line**

### **In Reference File:**
The reference file has a line at the bottom:
```
NEW VOTERS | - | - | 6,000,000 | 1,440,000 | 2,160,000 | Matiang'i | 40% | 60%
TOTAL      | 7,176,141 | 6,942,930 | 28,120,458 | 9,200,000 | 11,800,000 | Matiang'i | 43.8% | 56.2%
```

### **Explanation:**
This "NEW VOTERS" line is a **conceptual addition** showing how new voters would impact the race. However:

1. **The county-level data already includes new voters** distributed across all 47 counties
2. **The database correctly stores only the 47 counties** (19.5M votes)
3. **The "NEW VOTERS" line is NOT a 48th county** - it's a narrative element

### **Why the totals differ:**
- **County data (database):** 19.5M votes ✅ **This is correct**
- **Reference file "TOTAL" row:** 21M votes (includes separate "NEW VOTERS" line)

The database is **correct** because:
- New voters are already distributed in the county projections
- Adding a separate "NEW VOTERS" line would double-count them
- The county-level data is what should be visualized
