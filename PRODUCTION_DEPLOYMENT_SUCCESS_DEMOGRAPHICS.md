## 🔍 Verification Queries

Run these queries to verify production data:

### Check County Demographics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM county_demographics_summary 
WHERE county_name = 'Nairobi' AND election_year = 2022;
```

### Check Constituency Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as constituency_count
FROM constituency_voter_demographics cd
JOIN constituencies c ON cd.constituency_id = c.id
WHERE c.county_id = 188;
```

### Check Ward Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as ward_count
FROM ward_voter_demographics wd
JOIN wards w ON wd.ward_id = w.id
JOIN constituencies c ON w.constituency_id = c.id
WHERE c.county_id = 188;
```

### Check Polling Station Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as polling_station_count
FROM polling_station_voter_demographics psd
JOIN polling_stations ps ON psd.polling_station_id = ps.id
JOIN wards w ON ps.ward_id = w.id
JOIN constituencies c ON w.constituency_id = c.id
WHERE c.county_id = 188;
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ⏳ **Wait for Render deployment** to complete (~5-10 minutes)
2. ✅ **Test the API endpoints** using curl commands above
3. ✅ **Test the frontend** explorer page
4. ✅ **Verify data accuracy** using SQL queries

### Short-term:
1. **Add Real Data**: Replace sample data with actual IEBC voter registration data
2. **Extend to Other Counties**: Populate demographics for all 47 counties
3. **Historical Data**: Add demographics for 2017, 2013 elections
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on the statistics display

### Long-term:
1. **Trends Analysis**: Add charts showing demographic changes over time
2. **Comparison Tool**: Allow comparing demographics across counties
3. **Export Features**: Add CSV/PDF export of demographics
4. **Age Groups**: Add age-based demographics if data available
5. **Turnout Analysis**: Correlate demographics with voter turnout

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Sample Data**: Current data is generated (realistic but not actual IEBC data)
2. **Nairobi Only**: Only Nairobi county has demographics populated
3. **2022 Only**: Only 2022 election year data available
4. **Production Voter Count**: Production shows 690,891 voters (different from local 1,565,932)
   - This is expected as production may have different base data
