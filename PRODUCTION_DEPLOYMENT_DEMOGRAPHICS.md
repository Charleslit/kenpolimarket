# üöÄ Production Deployment - Voter Demographics Feature

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

---

## Executive Summary

The voter demographics feature has been successfully implemented and tested locally. The frontend builds successfully without errors. This document provides step-by-step instructions to deploy the feature to Render production.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Ready

### 1. **Database Migration** 
- ‚úÖ Migration file: `database/migrations/005_add_voter_demographics.sql`
- ‚úÖ Creates 4 new tables for voter demographics
- ‚úÖ Adds indexes and views for performance
- ‚úÖ Tested locally on Docker PostgreSQL

### 2. **Backend API**
- ‚úÖ New router: `backend/routers/voter_demographics.py`
- ‚úÖ Endpoints for all administrative levels (county, constituency, ward, polling station)
- ‚úÖ Integrated into main FastAPI app
- ‚úÖ Returns statistics with calculated percentages

### 3. **Frontend Components**
- ‚úÖ VoterStatisticsPanel component with charts
- ‚úÖ Map coordinate locking from GeoJSON
- ‚úÖ Explorer integration at all drill-down levels
- ‚úÖ **Build successful** - No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Responsive design

### 4. **Sample Data**
- ‚úÖ Nairobi demographics population script ready
- ‚úÖ Generates realistic voter distributions
- ‚úÖ Covers all 2,532 polling stations in Nairobi

---

## üéØ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Migration to Production Database

Run the migration script to create the voter demographics tables:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/apply_demographics_migration_to_production.py

# Run the migration
python3 scripts/apply_demographics_migration_to_production.py
```

**What it does:**
- Connects to Render production database
- Creates 4 new voter demographics tables
- Creates indexes for performance
- Creates summary views
- Verifies tables were created successfully

**You will need:**
- Render database password (from Render dashboard)

---

### Step 2: Populate Nairobi Demographics Data

After the migration succeeds, populate Nairobi with sample data:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/populate_nairobi_demographics_production.py

# Run the population script
python3 scripts/populate_nairobi_demographics_production.py
```

**What it does:**
- Populates Nairobi County demographics
- Populates all 17 constituencies
- Populates all 67 wards
- Populates all 2,532 polling stations
- Uses realistic demographic distributions (48-52% gender split, 2-3% PWD)

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ County demographics: Total=1,565,932, Male=757,697, Female=808,235, PWD=32,719
‚úÖ Populated 17 constituencies with demographics
‚úÖ Populated 67 wards with demographics
‚úÖ Populated 2,532 polling stations with demographics
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy Backend to Render

The backend code is already updated with the new router. Render will automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub:

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add voter demographics feature with gender and PWD statistics"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Render will automatically:**
- Detect the push
- Rebuild the backend
- Deploy the new version with voter demographics endpoints

**Monitor deployment:**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on **kenpolimarket-backend**
3. Watch the deployment logs
4. Wait for "Deploy succeeded" message

---

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Vercel/Render

The frontend build is successful. Deploy it:

**If using Vercel:**
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

**If using Render:**
```bash
# Push will trigger automatic deployment
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 5: Verify Production Deployment

After deployment, test the feature:

#### Test Backend API:
```bash
# Test Nairobi county demographics
curl https://kenpolimarket-backend.onrender.com/api/voter-demographics/counties/188?year=2022

# Expected response:
{
  "level": "county",
  "id": 188,
  "name": "Nairobi",
  "total_registered_voters": 1565932,
  "male_voters": 757697,
  "female_voters": 808235,
  "pwd_voters": 32719,
  "male_percentage": 48.39,
  "female_percentage": 51.61,
  "pwd_percentage": 2.09,
  "election_year": 2022
}
```

#### Test Frontend:
1. Navigate to: `https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app/explorer`
2. Click on **Nairobi County**
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Map zooms to Nairobi boundaries
   - ‚úÖ Statistics panel appears on the right
   - ‚úÖ Shows total voters, gender breakdown, PWD statistics
   - ‚úÖ Pie charts display correctly
4. Click on a **Constituency** (e.g., Westlands)
5. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Map zooms to constituency boundaries
   - ‚úÖ Statistics update to show constituency data
6. Click on a **Ward**
7. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Map zooms to ward boundaries
   - ‚úÖ Statistics update to show ward data
8. Click on a **Polling Station**
9. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Statistics show polling station data

## üîç Verification Queries

After deployment, you can verify the data using these SQL queries:

### Check County Demographics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM county_demographics_summary 
WHERE county_name = 'Nairobi' AND election_year = 2022;
```

### Check Constituency Demographics:
```sql
SELECT 
    c.name AS constituency,
    cd.total_registered_voters,
    cd.male_percentage,
    cd.female_percentage,
    cd.pwd_percentage
FROM constituency_voter_demographics cd
JOIN constituencies c ON cd.constituency_id = c.id
WHERE c.county_id = 188 AND cd.election_year = 2022
ORDER BY cd.total_registered_voters DESC;
```

### Check Ward Demographics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ward_demographics_full
WHERE county_name = 'Nairobi' AND election_year = 2022
ORDER BY total_registered_voters DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Polling Station Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_stations
FROM polling_station_voter_demographics psd
JOIN polling_stations ps ON psd.polling_station_id = ps.id
JOIN wards w ON ps.ward_id = w.id
JOIN constituencies c ON w.constituency_id = c.id
WHERE c.county_id = 188;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
**Issue:** "Table already exists" error  
**Solution:** Tables already created. Skip to Step 2 (populate data)

**Issue:** "Connection timeout"  
**Solution:** Check Render database is running and password is correct

### Data Population Fails
**Issue:** "Nairobi County not found"  
**Solution:** Verify Nairobi exists in production:
```sql
SELECT id, code, name FROM counties WHERE name = 'Nairobi';
```

### API Returns 404
**Issue:** Endpoint not found  
**Solution:** 
- Verify backend deployment succeeded
- Check backend logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure `voter_demographics.py` router is included in `main.py`

### Frontend Shows No Data
**Issue:** Statistics panel is empty  
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify API_URL environment variable is correct
- Test API endpoint directly with curl

### Map Doesn't Zoom
**Issue:** Map stays at default zoom  
**Solution:**
- Verify GeoJSON files are in `/public` directory
- Check county/constituency/ward names match between database and GeoJSON
- Check browser console for errors

## üìà Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Add Real Data**: Replace sample data with actual IEBC voter registration data
2. **Extend to Other Counties**: Run population script for all 47 counties
3. **Historical Data**: Add demographics for 2017, 2013 elections
4. **Analytics**: Add trends and comparison features
5. **Export**: Enable CSV/PDF export of demographics data
