## 🧮 **Next Feature: Scenario Calculator**

You requested a **calculator to tweak percentages** in regions and see the outcome. Here's the plan:

### **Feature: "What-If Scenario Builder"**

#### **Functionality:**
1. **Select a region** (e.g., Mount Kenya, Rift Valley, Nyanza)
2. **Adjust vote share** for each candidate using sliders
3. **See real-time impact** on national results
4. **Save scenarios** for comparison

#### **Example Use Case:**
```
Scenario: "What if Ruto wins back 20% of Mount Kenya?"

Current Mount Kenya:
- Ruto: 30% → Adjust to: 50%
- Matiang'i: 70% → Adjust to: 50%

Impact on National Results:
- Ruto: 41.3% → 45.8% (+4.5%)
- Matiang'i: 58.7% → 54.2% (-4.5%)
- Winner: Still Matiang'i, but closer race
```

#### **UI Components:**
1. **Region Selector** - Dropdown to choose region
2. **Candidate Sliders** - Adjust vote share (0-100%)
3. **Live Preview** - See updated national totals
4. **Comparison View** - Original vs Modified scenario
5. **Save Button** - Save scenario for later

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend:** React component with sliders and live calculations
- **Backend:** API endpoint to recalculate national totals
- **Database:** Optional - save scenarios as new forecast runs
